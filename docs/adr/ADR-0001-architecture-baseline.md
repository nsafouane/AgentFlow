# ADR-0001: AgentFlow Architecture Baseline

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AgentFlow requires a foundational architecture that supports production-ready multi-agent orchestration with enterprise-grade security, reliability, and scalability. The architecture must balance developer velocity with operational excellence while supporting diverse deployment scenarios from on-premise to cloud-native environments.

Key architectural forces include:
- Need for deterministic, reliable agent execution
- Multi-tenant isolation requirements for enterprise customers
- Security-first approach with tool execution sandboxing
- Cost-aware execution with budget controls
- Support for multiple LLM providers and on-premise models
- Horizontal scalability for high-throughput scenarios
- Developer experience optimization for rapid prototyping to production

## Decision
We will implement a Control Plane + Data Plane architecture with the following core components:

### Control Plane
- **REST/gRPC APIs** for workflow management and orchestration
- **Orchestrator** for deterministic plan execution using FSM and Behavior Tree planners
- **Registry** for tools, templates, and policies
- **Dashboard** for monitoring and management

### Data Plane
- **Worker Runtime** for agent execution with secure tool sandboxing
- **Message Bus** (NATS JetStream) for reliable inter-component communication
- **Storage Layer** with PostgreSQL for state and metadata
- **Memory Stores** for agent context and vector embeddings

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Go 1.22+ for core services
- **Message Bus**: NATS JetStream with Redis Streams fallback
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- **Container Runtime**: Docker with gVisor sandboxing for tools
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with Prometheus metrics

### Security Architecture
- **Tenant Isolation**: All data scoped by tenant_id with strict enforcement
- **Tool Sandboxing**: gVisor containers with execution profiles
- **Secret Management**: External secret providers, no hardcoded credentials
- **Supply Chain Security**: Signed containers, SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Clear separation of concerns between control and data planes enables independent scaling
- Go provides excellent performance, concurrency, and deployment characteristics
- NATS JetStream offers reliable messaging with built-in persistence and clustering
- PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees and mature ecosystem for enterprise requirements
- gVisor sandboxing provides strong isolation for untrusted tool execution
- Modular architecture supports diverse deployment scenarios

### Negative Consequences
- Additional complexity from distributed architecture requires sophisticated monitoring
- Go learning curve for teams primarily experienced with other languages
- NATS JetStream operational complexity compared to simpler message queues
- gVisor performance overhead compared to native container execution
- Multi-component deployment complexity compared to monolithic alternatives

### Neutral Consequences
- Increased number of moving parts requires comprehensive testing strategy
- Container-first approach requires container orchestration expertise
- Microservices architecture necessitates service mesh considerations for production

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: Single Go service handling all functionality
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging, lower operational overhead
- **Cons**: Scaling limitations, harder to isolate failures, deployment coupling
- **Why not chosen**: Doesn't support independent scaling of control vs data plane operations

### Alternative 2: Python-based Architecture
- **Description**: Python services with FastAPI and Celery
- **Pros**: Rich AI/ML ecosystem, familiar to ML engineers, extensive libraries
- **Cons**: Performance limitations, GIL constraints, deployment complexity
- **Why not chosen**: Performance requirements and operational complexity favor Go

### Alternative 3: Event Sourcing Architecture
- **Description**: Event-driven architecture with event store as primary persistence
- **Pros**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, replay capabilities
- **Cons**: Complexity overhead, eventual consistency challenges, query complexity
- **Why not chosen**: Adds significant complexity without clear benefit for initial MVP

### Alternative 4: Serverless-First Architecture
- **Description**: AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions for all components
- **Pros**: Automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, limited execution time, debugging complexity
- **Why not chosen**: Cold start latency incompatible with real-time agent execution requirements
