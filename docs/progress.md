- [x] Task 2: Audit Hash-Chain Columns - ✅ COMPLETED 2025-08-24

### Q1.2 Key Achievement (Task 3)

- Implemented OpenTelemetry tracer with OTLP HTTP exporter and Jaeger-compatible configuration
- Automatic trace context injection into outgoing messages (headers and message fields) and extraction from incoming messages
- Created span creation and linking for message bus operations (messaging.publish <subject>, messaging.consume <subject>, messaging.replay <workflow_id>) with semantic attributes
- Added unit tests verifying context propagation, span creation, and trace continuity across message hops; tests passing
- Added manual test `TestManualTracingJaeger` with instructions to verify traces in Jaeger UI
- Documentation updated in `/docs/messaging.md` with conventions, config, and troubleshooting

### Q1.2 Key Achievement (Task 4)

- Implemented Structured Logging Baseline (2025-08-17)

	- Created a JSON-structured logger wrapper (`internal/logging/logger.go`) with deterministic field ordering and `NewLoggerWithWriter()` for flexible outputs.
	- Automatic enrichment of correlation fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `message_id`, `workflow_id`, `agent_id`) via context-aware helpers (`WithTrace()`, `WithMessage()`, `WithWorkflow()`, `WithAgent()`).
	- Reserved field validation and linting rules to prevent accidental overrides of critical keys.
	- Integrated structured logging across messaging operations (publish, consume, replay) with preservation of correlation context across goroutines and message boundaries.
	- Added unit and integration tests (`pkg/messaging/logging_integration_test.go`) and a manual ping-pong test (`pkg/messaging/ping_pong_manual_test.go`) verifying correlation propagation and field validation; tests pass locally.

	Verification: Unit and integration tests pass; manual ping-pong logging verification documented in `/docs/messaging.md`.

### Q1.2 Key Achievements (Task 2)

- Implemented NATS JetStream client with connection management and configurable AF_BUS_URL
- Created stream configurations for `AF_MESSAGES`, `AF_TOOLS`, `AF_SYSTEM` with retention and replica settings
- Publish/subscribe functionality with durable consumers, acknowledgements, and replay support
- Retry policies with exponential backoff & jitter for connection resilience
- Unit tests covering connection, streams, publish/subscribe, ordering, replay, and retry logic
- Manual latency measurement test and documentation updates in `/docs/messaging.md`

---

### Q1.2 Key Achievement (Task 5)

- Implemented Performance Harness core (`pkg/messaging/performance_harness.go`) and benchmark suite (`pkg/messaging/benchmark_test.go`) supporting configurable message count, concurrency, and payload size.
- Statistical analysis includes P50, P95, and P99 latency calculations with latency histogram export and throughput/error metrics.
- CI integration scripts (`scripts/test-performance.sh`, `scripts/test-performance.ps1`) enforce P95 < 15ms by default with environment-specific overrides and produce JSON reports for baseline and regression checks.
- Unit tests for assertion logic and percentile calculations pass (8/8); manual benchmark helpers export baselines used by regression detection.
- Performance targets met in local runs: P95 < 15ms, P50 < 5ms, throughput > 100 msg/sec, error rate < 1%.

### Q1.3 Key Achievement (Task 1)

- Implemented Core Schema Migrations (2025-08-24)
  - Created comprehensive migration (`migrations/20250824000000_core_schema.sql`) with all 11 core tables: tenants, users, agents, workflows, plans, messages, tools, audits, budgets, rbac_roles, rbac_bindings
  - Multi-tenant isolation with tenant_id columns and CASCADE delete constraints for data integrity
  - Performance optimization with 20+ strategic indexes including tenant isolation, query optimization, and JSONB GIN indexes
  - SQLC integration with type-safe Go code generation using PostgreSQL engine and pgx/v5 driver
  - Comprehensive unit tests for migration structure validation (8 test cases) and SQLC generated code compilation (4 test cases); all tests passing
  - Manual test procedures documented (`docs/manual-test-procedures.md`) covering fresh migrate, seed data, rollback, re-migrate cycle with cross-platform validation
  - Schema ER diagram documentation (`docs/schema-er-diagram.md`) with Mermaid visualization showing table relationships and multi-tenant isolation patterns
  - Hash-chain audit support, message envelope integration ready for Q1.2, and RBAC foundation for access control

### Q1.3 Key Achievement (Task 2)

- Implemented Audit Hash-Chain Columns (2025-08-24)
  - Added `prev_hash BYTEA` and `hash BYTEA NOT NULL` columns to audits table with proper hash-chain implementation
  - Implemented SHA-256 hash computation function: `SHA256(prev_hash || canonical_json(audit_record))` with deterministic JSON serialization
  - Created audit record insertion logic maintaining chronological hash chain integrity with proper genesis record handling (nil prev_hash)
  - Built comprehensive hash-chain verification algorithm validating entire chain integrity with tamper detection and forensic analysis
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering append-only integrity, tamper detection scenarios, and edge cases (15/15 test cases passing)
  - CLI audit verification command (`af audit verify`) with tenant-specific verification, JSON output, and performance metrics
  - Complete documentation (`docs/audit-hash-chain.md`) covering algorithm details, security properties, operational procedures, and compliance considerations
  - Manual test script (`scripts/test-audit-tamper-detection.sh`) demonstrating end-to-end tamper detection capabilities
