- Multi-layered security scanning catches different vulnerability types effectively
- Supply chain security (SBOM, signing, provenance) is critical for enterprise adoption
- Quality gates with clear thresholds prevent security debt accumulation
- Comprehensive CI policy documentation reduces onboarding friction for new developers
- Security tooling integration requires both automated and manual testing approaches
- Cross-platform security scripts need careful syntax handling for PowerShell vs Bash
- Unit tests for security tools should include mock data parsing and threshold validation
- Security baseline documentation with formal exception processes is essential for enterprise adoption
- Configurable severity thresholds allow flexibility while maintaining security standards
- Database migration tooling requires strict reversibility policies for production safety
- Type-safe database access through code generation prevents runtime SQL errors
- Migration testing must include both automated linting and manual cross-platform validation
- Windows path handling in database tools requires careful normalization and testing
- Comprehensive migration governance documentation is critical for team adoption
