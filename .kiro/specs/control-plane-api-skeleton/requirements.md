# Requirements Document - Control Plane API Skeleton

## Introduction

The Control Plane API Skeleton provides the foundational HTTP/REST API layer for AgentFlow, enabling external clients to interact with workflows, agents, tools, and budgets. This API serves as the primary interface for the AgentFlow system, supporting multi-tenancy, authentication, authorization, and cost management. The API must be production-ready with proper security controls, rate limiting, and observability integration.

This specification builds upon the completed Q1.3 relational storage and Q1.2 messaging backbone to provide a comprehensive API layer that will enable Q2 enterprise features including advanced cost controls, model gateway integration, and external SDK usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP Server Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust HTTP server with proper middleware stack, so that I can reliably interact with AgentFlow APIs with full observability and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the control plane starts THEN the system SHALL expose HTTP endpoints on /api/v1 with proper routing
2. WHEN any API request is received THEN the system SHALL apply middleware for logging, tracing, and recovery in the correct order
3. WHEN an unhandled error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response and log the incident with correlation IDs
4. WHEN the server receives a request THEN the system SHALL propagate OpenTelemetry trace context from Q1.2 messaging integration
5. WHEN the server processes requests THEN the system SHALL emit structured logs with correlation fields (trace_id, span_id, tenant_id, user_id)

### Requirement 2: Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure authentication with JWT tokens and optional OIDC integration, so that I can control access to AgentFlow resources with enterprise-grade security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests a token THEN the system SHALL issue JWT tokens with tenant and role claims using a configurable secret
2. WHEN a client provides a JWT token THEN the system SHALL validate the token signature, expiration, and claims before allowing access
3. WHEN OIDC is enabled via feature flag THEN the system SHALL support external identity provider integration for token validation
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with structured error details and audit the failed attempt
5. WHEN a token is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL block access to protected endpoints and log the security event

### Requirement 3: Multi-Tenancy Enforcement

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want strict tenant isolation at the API layer, so that customers cannot access each other's data or resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is authenticated THEN the system SHALL extract tenant_id from JWT claims and scope all database queries by tenant
2. WHEN a client attempts cross-tenant access THEN the system SHALL deny the request and audit the violation attempt
3. WHEN message bus operations are performed THEN the system SHALL prefix subjects with tenant identifiers for isolation
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL ensure no cross-tenant data leakage in response payloads
5. WHEN tenant switching is attempted THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication with appropriate tenant credentials

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want granular role-based permissions (admin, developer, viewer), so that I can implement least-privilege access controls across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is assigned a role THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions using the rbac_roles and rbac_bindings tables from Q1.3
2. WHEN a viewer role attempts write operations THEN the system SHALL deny the request with HTTP 403 and audit the attempt
3. WHEN an admin performs privileged operations THEN the system SHALL allow access and log the administrative action
4. WHEN role bindings change THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new permissions without requiring re-authentication
5. WHEN RBAC evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL default to deny access and log the authorization failure

### Requirement 5: Rate Limiting & Quota Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want configurable rate limiting per tenant and endpoint, so that I can prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage across customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL implement sliding window or token bucket algorithms using Redis from Q1.3
2. WHEN a client exceeds rate limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with appropriate retry headers and quota information
3. WHEN burst traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL handle temporary spikes while maintaining sustained rate enforcement
4. WHEN rate limit windows reset THEN the system SHALL allow requests to resume without manual intervention
5. WHEN quota violations occur THEN the system SHALL emit metrics and optionally notify administrators based on configuration

### Requirement 6: OpenAPI Specification & SDK Generation

**User Story:** As an external developer, I want comprehensive API documentation and generated SDKs, so that I can integrate with AgentFlow using my preferred programming language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification with complete endpoint documentation
2. WHEN API changes are made THEN the system SHALL detect breaking changes and require explicit approval through CI/CD
3. WHEN SDKs are generated THEN the system SHALL produce Python and JavaScript client libraries with proper error handling
4. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guidance
5. WHEN developers access documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive API explorer with authentication examples

### Requirement 7: Cost Estimation & Budget Integration

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want upfront cost estimates for workflow plans, so that I can make informed decisions about resource usage before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plan is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates using PlanCostModel heuristics with token and tool cost tables
2. WHEN cost estimates are requested THEN the system SHALL return structured cost breakdown by model, tool, and estimated duration
3. WHEN budget limits are configured THEN the system SHALL warn users when estimated costs approach or exceed budgets
4. WHEN cost estimation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback estimates and log the estimation error for calibration
5. WHEN actual costs are observed THEN the system SHALL track variance between estimates and actuals for model improvement

### Requirement 8: Tool Permission & Security Profiles

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want deny-by-default tool permissions with explicit allow-lists, so that I can ensure tools cannot perform unauthorized operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are registered THEN the system SHALL compile ExecProfile with explicit permissions, timeouts, and resource limits
2. WHEN tools request network access THEN the system SHALL validate against allow-listed domains and deny unauthorized requests
3. WHEN tools attempt file system access THEN the system SHALL enforce read-only or temporary directory restrictions based on profile
4. WHEN permission violations occur THEN the system SHALL block the operation, audit the attempt, and alert security teams
5. WHEN execution profiles are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new restrictions without service restart

### Requirement 9: Data Minimization & PII Protection

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automatic PII redaction and data minimization, so that I can meet privacy regulations and reduce data exposure risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data minimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply redaction rules to logs, audit trails, and API responses
2. WHEN PII is detected THEN the system SHALL redact sensitive information using configurable patterns and replacement strategies
3. WHEN redaction rules are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain data utility while removing personally identifiable information
4. WHEN compliance audits occur THEN the system SHALL demonstrate zero PII leakage in processed data samples
5. WHEN redaction fails THEN the system SHALL err on the side of over-redaction and log the redaction failure for review

### Requirement 10: Residency & Data Sovereignty

**User Story:** As an enterprise customer with data residency requirements, I want strict controls over data egress and model usage, so that I can comply with regional data protection laws.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN residency strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL block all external network requests not on the approved allow-list
2. WHEN model requests are made THEN the system SHALL route to on-premise providers when residency constraints are active
3. WHEN egress attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log and block unauthorized data transfers with detailed audit trails
4. WHEN allow-lists are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new egress policies without service interruption
5. WHEN residency violations are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and optionally halt processing based on configuration
