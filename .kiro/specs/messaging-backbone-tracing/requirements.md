# Requirements Document - Messaging Backbone & Tracing Skeleton

## Introduction

The Messaging Backbone & Tracing Skeleton establishes the foundational communication infrastructure for AgentFlow's distributed multi-agent system. This component provides deterministic message routing, replay capabilities, and comprehensive observability through distributed tracing and structured logging. The system must support high-throughput message processing with sub-15ms p95 latency while maintaining message integrity through cryptographic hashing and enabling time-travel debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want deterministic message serialization and hashing, so that I can ensure message integrity and enable reliable replay functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is serialized THEN the system SHALL produce a deterministic SHA256 envelope_hash based on canonical field ordering
2. WHEN the same message content is serialized multiple times THEN the system SHALL produce identical envelope_hash values
3. WHEN message fields are reordered THEN the canonical serializer SHALL produce the same envelope_hash
4. IF a message is tampered with THEN the envelope_hash verification SHALL detect the modification
5. WHEN extending the message schema THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing hash verification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a distributed system developer, I want reliable publish/subscribe messaging with replay capabilities, so that I can build resilient multi-agent workflows with recovery mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent publishes a message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all subscribed agents within 15ms p95
2. WHEN a subscriber is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages using durable subscriptions
3. WHEN replay is requested for a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide messages in original chronological order
4. WHEN message acknowledgment fails THEN the system SHALL redeliver the message according to configured retry policy
5. IF the message bus is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want distributed tracing across all message flows, so that I can debug complex multi-agent interactions and measure end-to-end performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is published THEN the system SHALL inject OpenTelemetry trace context into message headers
2. WHEN a message is consumed THEN the system SHALL extract and continue the distributed trace
3. WHEN tracing a workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain trace continuity across all agent interactions
4. WHEN viewing traces in Jaeger THEN the system SHALL display complete end-to-end message flows
5. IF trace context is missing THEN the system SHALL create a new root span and log the occurrence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want structured logging with correlation IDs, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues and correlate events across distributed components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component logs an event THEN the system SHALL include trace_id, span_id, and message_id in JSON format
2. WHEN processing a message THEN the system SHALL enrich all log entries with correlation identifiers
3. WHEN searching logs THEN operators SHALL be able to filter by trace_id to see all related events
4. WHEN log aggregation occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all correlation fields for analysis
5. IF correlation IDs are missing THEN the system SHALL generate and propagate new identifiers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want comprehensive latency measurements and benchmarking, so that I can ensure the messaging system meets SLA requirements and detect performance regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring message routing THEN the system SHALL achieve p95 latency < 15ms on CI Linux environments
2. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure and report p50 and p95 latencies
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the CI system SHALL fail builds that exceed latency thresholds
4. WHEN benchmarking locally THEN developers SHALL be able to record baseline performance metrics
5. IF performance thresholds are environment-specific THEN the system SHALL allow threshold overrides via environment variables

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want message contract validation and schema evolution, so that I can ensure API compatibility and prevent breaking changes in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining message schemas THEN the system SHALL validate all messages against JSON schema definitions
2. WHEN evolving message formats THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
3. WHEN invalid messages are received THEN the system SHALL reject them and log validation errors
4. WHEN schema changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL provide clear evolution guidelines
5. IF schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the specific validation failures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable NATS JetStream integration, so that I can deploy AgentFlow in different environments with appropriate message durability and performance settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the message bus THEN the system SHALL support connection via AF_BUS_URL environment variable
2. WHEN setting up streams THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate retention policies and replica counts
3. WHEN consumers connect THEN the system SHALL establish durable subscriptions with configurable acknowledgment timeouts
4. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
5. IF NATS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry connection attempts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want tamper-evident message integrity, so that I can verify that messages have not been modified during transmission or storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is created THEN the system SHALL compute and store an envelope_hash covering all message content
2. WHEN a message is received THEN the system SHALL verify the envelope_hash matches the message content
3. WHEN hash verification fails THEN the system SHALL reject the message and create an audit log entry
4. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL preserve the original envelope_hash for later verification
5. IF message content is modified THEN subsequent hash verification SHALL detect the tampering
