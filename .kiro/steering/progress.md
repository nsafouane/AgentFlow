## Progress Tracking Guidelines

### Spec-Level Progress Tracking

When working on any spec, always update progress using this format:

```markdown
## Spec Status: [NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | COMPLETED]

### Current Phase: [Implementation | Unit Testing | Manual Testing | Documentation]

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Task 1: Brief description
- [x] Task 2: Brief description

### In Progress:
- [ ] Task 3: Brief description (Started: YYYY-MM-DD, Assignee: Name)

### Blocked Items:
- [ ] Task 4: Brief description (Blocked by: dependency/issue, Since: YYYY-MM-DD)

### Next Steps:
1. Immediate next action
2. Following action
3. Dependencies to resolve
```

### Task-Level Progress Documentation

For each task, document progress in the implementation files:

```go
// Progress: COMPLETED - 2024-01-15
// Implementation: ✓ Core functionality complete
// Unit Tests: ✓ 85% coverage achieved
// Manual Testing: ✓ Cross-platform validation passed
// Documentation: ✓ README updated with examples
func ExampleFunction() {
    // implementation
}
```

### Gate Criteria Tracking

Each quarter has specific gate criteria that must be met. Track these systematically:

#### Gate G0 (Q1 Exit) Criteria Status:
- [ ] CI green incl. security scans
- [ ] Cross-platform builds (Linux + Windows + WSL2)
- [ ] Devcontainer adoption (`af validate` warns outside container)
- [ ] SBOM & provenance (artifacts published per build)
- [ ] Signed multi-arch images (amd64+arm64, cosign verify passes)
- [ ] Risk register & ADR baseline (merged)
- [ ] Release versioning policy (RELEASE.md published & CI referenced)
- [ ] Interface freeze snapshot (/docs/interfaces committed)
- [ ] Threat model kickoff scheduled (logged in risk register)

## Progress Reporting Standards

### Daily Progress Updates
When making significant progress, update relevant tracking documents:

1. **Spec Progress**: Update the spec's tasks.md file
2. **Implementation Notes**: Add progress comments to code
3. **Blockers**: Document any impediments immediately
4. **Dependencies**: Note what you're waiting for

### Weekly Progress Summary
Create weekly summaries in this format:

```markdown
## Week of YYYY-MM-DD

### Completed This Week:
- Spec Q1.1 Task 3: Security tooling integration
- Gate G0 Criterion: Cross-platform builds validated

### In Progress:
- Spec Q1.1 Task 4: Migration tooling setup (80% complete)

### Blockers Resolved:
- Windows path issue in devcontainer (resolved with path normalization)

### New Blockers:
- None

### Next Week Focus:
- Complete Q1.1 remaining tasks
- Begin Q1.2 messaging backbone
```

### Milestone Documentation

For major milestones (spec completion, gate passage), create detailed documentation:

```markdown
## Milestone: Q1.1 Foundations & Project Governance - COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: X weeks
**Team Members**: List contributors

### Key Achievements:
- Repository structure established
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Security baseline implemented
- Development environment standardized

### Metrics Achieved:
- Build success rate: 100%
- Security scan pass rate: 100%
- Cross-platform compatibility: Linux, Windows, WSL2

### Lessons Learned:
- Windows path handling required special attention
- Early security integration prevented later rework
- Devcontainer adoption improved developer onboarding

### Artifacts Delivered:
- [Link to completed spec]
- [Link to implementation]
- [Link to documentation]
```

## Quality Gates & Validation

### Before Marking Tasks Complete:
1. **Implementation**: Code is functional and follows conventions
2. **Unit Tests**: Minimum coverage thresholds met
3. **Manual Testing**: Cross-platform validation completed
4. **Documentation**: User-facing docs updated
5. **Code Review**: Peer review completed
6. **Security Review**: Security implications assessed

### Before Advancing to Next Spec:
1. All tasks in current spec completed
2. Exit criteria validated
3. Dependencies for next spec satisfied
4. Blockers resolved or documented with mitigation plans

## Risk & Issue Tracking

### Risk Documentation Format:
```markdown
## Risk: [Risk Title]
**ID**: RISK-YYYY-NNN
**Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Probability**: Very High | High | Medium | Low | Very Low
**Impact**: [Description of potential impact]
**Mitigation**: [Current mitigation strategy]
**Owner**: [Responsible person]
**Status**: Open | Mitigated | Accepted | Closed
**Last Review**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Issue Escalation Process:
1. **Document immediately** in relevant spec or progress file
2. **Assess impact** on current and downstream work
3. **Identify mitigation options** and timeline
4. **Escalate if blocking** critical path items
5. **Update stakeholders** on resolution progress

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Velocity Metrics:
- Specs completed per quarter
- Tasks completed per week
- Time from spec start to completion
- Blocker resolution time

### Quality Metrics:
- Test coverage percentage
- Security scan pass rate
- Cross-platform compatibility rate
- Documentation completeness

### Performance Metrics:
- Build time trends
- CI/CD pipeline success rate
- Development environment setup time
- Time to first working demo

## Communication & Reporting

### Progress Communication Channels:
- **Spec Updates**: Update tasks.md files directly
- **Weekly Summaries**: Include in team communications
- **Milestone Reports**: Share with stakeholders
- **Blocker Alerts**: Immediate communication for critical issues

### Documentation Standards:
- Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Include assignee information for in-progress items
- Link to relevant artifacts and dependencies
- Maintain traceability from requirements to implementation
