# AgentFlow

AgentFlow is a production-ready multi-agent framework designed to eliminate the complexity gap between AI prototypes and production systems. It delivers enterprise-grade multi-agent orchestration with deterministic planning, cost-aware execution, and security-first architecture.

## Architecture Overview

AgentFlow follows a modular architecture with clear separation between control plane, data plane, and client interfaces.

### Module Boundaries

#### Control Plane (`cmd/control-plane/`)
- REST/gRPC APIs for workflow management
- Orchestrator for plan execution
- Registry for tools, templates, and policies
- Dashboard backend services

#### Data Plane (`cmd/worker/`)
- Agent runtime execution
- Message processing
- Tool execution with sandboxing
- Memory operations

#### CLI Tool (`cmd/af/`)
- Project initialization and templates
- Configuration management
- Deployment commands
- Validation and debugging tools

### Package Design Principles

#### Internal Packages (`internal/`)
- **Not importable** by external projects
- Shared utilities across AgentFlow services
- Implementation details that may change
- Security-sensitive code

#### Public API Packages (`pkg/`)
- **Stable interfaces** for external consumption
- Minimal dependencies
- Well-documented with examples
- Backward compatibility guarantees

#### Service Commands (`cmd/`)
- Thin main functions
- Dependency injection setup
- Configuration loading
- Service lifecycle management

## Repository Conventions

### Go Module Structure
- Each service (`cmd/*`) has its own `go.mod` for independent versioning
- SDK modules (`sdk/*`) have separate `go.mod` files for language-specific dependencies
- Root `go.mod` contains shared dependencies and internal packages
- All modules use replace directives to reference the root module during development

### Build System
- **Makefile**: Primary build system for Unix-like systems
- **Taskfile.yml**: Cross-platform task runner for Windows compatibility
- Both build systems provide equivalent functionality:
  - `build`: Compile all components
  - `test`: Run all tests
  - `lint`: Run code quality checks
  - `clean`: Remove build artifacts
  - `deps`: Update dependencies

### Cross-Platform Support
- All build scripts work on Linux, Windows, and WSL2
- Platform-specific binary extensions handled automatically
- Path normalization for Windows compatibility
- Consistent behavior across different development environments

### Code Quality Standards
- golangci-lint configuration in `.golangci.yml`
- Minimum test coverage requirements
- Consistent code formatting with gofmt/goimports
- Security scanning with gosec integration

### Naming Conventions
- **Go Packages**: Lowercase, single word when possible
- **Files**: Lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names
- **Directories**: Clear purpose indication
- **Modules**: Follow Go module naming conventions

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

The fastest way to get started is using our pre-configured VS Code devcontainer:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Quick Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agentflow/agentflow.git
   cd agentflow
   code .
   # Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   ```

3. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   af validate
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, including Windows/macOS host setup, see [Development Environment Guide](docs/dev-environment.md).

### Quick Start

1. **Build all components**:
   ```bash
   make build
   # or
   task build
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   make test
   # or
   task test
   ```

3. **Start development services**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   # or
   task dev
   ```

### Database Migrations

AgentFlow uses goose for database schema management and sqlc for type-safe query generation:

1. **Create new migration**:
   ```bash
   make migrate-create NAME=add_user_table
   # or
   task migrate-create NAME=add_user_table
   ```

2. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   make migrate-up
   # or
   task migrate-up
   ```

3. **Generate type-safe queries**:
   ```bash
   make sqlc-generate
   # or
   task sqlc-generate
   ```

For detailed migration policies and procedures, see [Migration Policy](docs/migration-policy.md).

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Quality**: Run linting before committing
   ```bash
   make lint
   ```

2. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Cross-Platform**: Test builds on multiple platforms
   ```bash
   make build-all
   ```
