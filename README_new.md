## üöÄ Quick Start

Get AgentFlow running in under 5 minutes:

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.22+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (for services)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AgentFlow/agentflow.git
cd agentflow

# Option 1: Use VS Code Dev Container (recommended)
code .
# Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted

# Option 2: Local setup
make build
af validate
```

### Your First Workflow

```bash
# Initialize a new project
af init my-workflow --template simple-pipeline

# Start the services
make dev

# Deploy your workflow
af deploy my-workflow

# Monitor execution
af logs my-workflow --follow
```

## üìñ Documentation

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Getting Started**](docs/getting-started.md) | Complete setup and first workflow tutorial |
| [**Architecture Guide**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | System design and component overview |
| [**API Reference**](docs/api/) | REST and gRPC API documentation |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

AgentFlow uses a **control plane / data plane** architecture for scalability and reliability:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Control Plane"
        API[REST/gRPC APIs]
        ORCH[Orchestrator]
        REG[Registry]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Plane" 
        WORKER[Agent Workers]
        BUS[Message Bus]
        TOOLS[Tool Executor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage"
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        CACHE[(Redis)]
        VECTOR[(Vector DB)]
    end
    
    API --> ORCH
    ORCH --> BUS
    WORKER --> BUS
    WORKER --> TOOLS
    API --> DB
    WORKER --> CACHE
    WORKER --> VECTOR
```

### Core Components

- **Control Plane**: Manages workflows, exposes APIs, handles authentication
- **Data Plane**: Executes agents, processes messages, runs tools securely  
- **Storage Layer**: Persists state, caches data, stores agent memory
